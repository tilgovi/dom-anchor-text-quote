    have been planted across the city so far, with Manhattan receiving 49,045 trees (9.8 percent of the 500,000) and the

        <alt-code value="Bronx (NYC)" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Bronx</location> getting 135,626 trees, or 27.1 percent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="482"
    data-total-count="5460">To address residents’ concerns, the city has introduced a number of programs. For buckling sidewalks, for instance, the city
    now does repairs in front of one- to three-family homes; in the past, it was the homeowner’s responsibility. Since starting
    a repair program several years ago, the city has received 38,300 requests, and it has addressed 9,169 so far. To prevent
    buckling in the first place, all new trees have considerably larger beds, allowing room for spreading roots.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content"
    data-para-count="179" data-total-count="5639">As for pruning, the city says it responds to all complaints about dead limbs or trees within 30 days; if the condition is
    deemed hazardous, the work will be performed immediately.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333"
    data-total-count="5972">The parks department, with the nonprofit group
    <a href="http://www.treesny.org/">Trees New York</a>, has stepped up its “citizen pruner” program, in which residents can become trained and certified
    to do limited pruning of street trees. The one limitation, however, is that citizen pruners must keep their feet on the
    ground, which prevents most work on taller trees.</p>
